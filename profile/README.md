## Hi there 👋

In this organization you can find my Codam's Curriculum projects.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

Each project repository starts with a number that represents the level in which that project belongs to.
Codam's Core curriculum consists of 7 levels, each of increasing difficulty.

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
